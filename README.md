This is a MERN stack app hosted on heroku. [Just in Case](https://crwdhire.herokuapp.com/)

The app is to help people just in case of an emergency.  It acts a wallet for essential emergency information, such as allergy listings, blood type, insurance, etc. so that emergency personnel can quickly access essential information that could potentially save your life.  Eventually we would like it to be accessible from the lock screen so emergency personnel could access it without you having to first unlock your phone.

It can also be used as a way to ensure you always have your information with you, whether you are visiting the doctor or the ER.  It will also give you the capability to take a picture of your children and insurance information, just in case.  The app will occasionally prompt you to update your information to ensure it stays current and relevant.  Furthermore, we will eventually add an upload option giving you the option to store files such as fingerprints, living wills, DNRs, etc.  We would also like to use encryption such as SSL or another means to ultimately secure the data and keep it safe.  You know why?  Just in case!
