## *** You never know when you'll need it ***

#### An app to hold your essential information just in case of an emergency

#### Designed and Developed By:

##### Sal Giani
##### Matt Stringham
##### Kristoffer Keene
##### Jeannie Root
##### Kenneth Masteller

This is a MERN stack app hosted on heroku. [Just in Case](https://crwdhire.herokuapp.com/)

The app is to help people just in case of an emergency.  It acts a wallet for essential emergency information, such as allergy listings, blood type, insurance, etc. so that emergency personnel can quickly access essential information that could potentially save your life.  Eventually we would like it to be accessible from the lock screen so emergency personnel could access it without you having to first unlock your phone.

It can also be used as a way to ensure you always have your information with you, whether you are visiting the doctor or the ER.  It will also give you the capability to take a picture of your children and insurance information, just in case.  The app will occasionally prompt you to update your information to ensure it stays current and relevant.  Furthermore, we will eventually add an upload option giving you the option to store files such as fingerprints, living wills, DNRs, etc.  We would also like to use encryption such as SSL or another means to ultimately secure the data and keep it safe.  You know why?  Just in case!

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following commands:

```
yarn install
cd client
yarn install
cd ..
``

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
yarn start
```

That's it, your app should be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Deployment (Heroku)

After confirming that you have an up to date git repository and a Heroku app created, complete the following:

1. Build the React app for production by running the following command:

```
yarn build
```
> Note: A yarn build will be required to register any new Post requests from any front-end JavaScript to to prevent any proxy server errors.

2. Add and commit all changes to git

3. Push to Heroku

If all previous steps were followed correctly, your application should be deployed to Heroku!
